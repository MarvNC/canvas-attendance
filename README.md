This script takes a CSV file generated by a Canvas gradebook export, and creates attendance sheets for each course CRN as markdown and PDF files.

- Install [bun](https://bun.sh)
- Install dependencies: `bun install`
- Export Canvas gradebook csv (Export -> Export Entire Gradebook)
- Save the CSV to `/data`
- Run the script: `bun run . <path to canvas csv>`

The resulting files will be in the `/output` directory.
