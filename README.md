# canvas-attendance

This script takes a CSV file generated by a canvas gradebook export, and creates attendance sheets for each course CRN as markdown and PDF files.

- Install [bun](https://bun.sh)
- Install dependencies: `bun install`
- Run the script: `bun run . <path to canvas csv>`

The resulting files will be in the `output` directory.
